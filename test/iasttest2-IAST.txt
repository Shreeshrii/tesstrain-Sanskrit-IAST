like a heap, the letter and word are not separated,
one half may be said to be the letter and the
other half, the word. Jnst as the whole can never
be talked of as apart from its parts; so a word
cannot be uttered apart from its constitnent letters.
Hence the Smriti : “ The Goddess is the Ardha-
ṁmáātrá which is unntterable in any specific way ”
( š. e. apart from the lettere ). [ Markandeya
Purana—Durgasaptasati I.]
